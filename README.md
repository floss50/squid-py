## Features

Squid-py include the methods to make easy the connection with contracts deployed in different networks.
This repository include also the methods to encrypt and decrypt information.

## Prerequisites

Python 3.6

## Quick-start

Install Squid:

```
pip install squid-py
```

### Usage:

```python
import os
import time

from squid_py import (
    Ocean, 
    ServiceDescriptor, 
    ACCESS_SERVICE_TEMPLATE_ID,
    get_service_endpoint,
    get_purchase_endpoint,
)
from squid_py.ddo.metadata import Metadata

# Make a new instance of Ocean
ocean = Ocean('config.ini')  # or Ocean(config_dict)
# You can set a specific ethereum account to use by using `ocean.set_main_account(address, password)` 
# Ocean picks up address and password by default from the parity.address and parity.password in the config

# PUBLISHER
# Let's start by registering an asset in the Ocean network
metadata = Metadata.get_example()

# purchase and service endpoints require `brizo.url` is set in the config file 
# or passed to Ocean instance in the config_dict.
purchase_endpoint = get_purchase_endpoint(ocean.config)
service_endpoint = get_service_endpoint(ocean.config)
# define the services to include in the new asset DDO
service_descriptor = ServiceDescriptor.access_service_descriptor(2, purchase_endpoint, service_endpoint, 900, ACCESS_SERVICE_TEMPLATE_ID)

ddo = ocean.register_asset(metadata, ocean.main_account.address, service_descriptor)

# Now we have an asset registered, we can verify it exists by resolving the did
_ddo = ocean.resolve_did(ddo.did)
# ddo and _ddo should be identical

# CONSUMER
# search for assets
asset = ocean.search_assets_by_text('Ocean protocol')[0]
# Need some ocean tokens to be able to purchase assets
ocean.main_account.unlock()
ocean.keeper.market.request_tokens(10, ocean.main_account.address)
# Start the purchase/consume request. This will automatically make a payment from the specified account.
service_agreement_id = ocean.sign_service_agreement(asset.did, 0, ocean.main_account.address)
# after a short wait (seconds to minutes) the asset data files should be available in the `downloads.path` defined in config
# wait a bit to let things happen
time.sleep(30)
# Asset files are saved in a folder named after the asset DID
if os.path.exists(ocean.get_asset_folder_path(asset.did, 0)):
    print('asset files downloaded: {}'.format(os.listdir(ocean.get_asset_folder_path(asset.did, 0))))

```

## Configuration

```python
config_dict = {
    'keeper-contracts': {
        # Point to an Ethereum RPC client. Note that Squid learns the name of the network to work with from this client.
        'keeper.url': 'http://localhost:8545',
        # Specify the keeper contracts artifacts folder (has the smart contracts definitions json files). When you 
        # install the package, the artifacts are automatically picked up from the `keeper-contracts` Python 
        # dependency unless you are using a local ethereum network.
        'keeper.path': 'artifacts', 
        'secret_store.url': 'http://localhost:12001',
        'parity.url': 'http://localhost:8545',
        'parity.address': '',
        'parity.password': '',
    
    },
    'resources': {
        # aquarius is the metadata store. It stores the assets DDO/DID-document
        'aquarius.url': 'http://localhost:5000',
        # Brizo is the publisher's agent. It serves purchase and requests for both data access and compute services 
        'brizo.url': 'http://localhost:8030',
        # points to the local database file used for storing temporary information (for instance, pending service agreements).
        'storage.path': 'squid_py.db',
        # Where to store downloaded asset files
        'downloads.path': 'consume-downloads'
    }
}

```

In addition to the configuration file, you may use the following environment variables (override the corresponding configuration file values):

- KEEPER_PATH
- KEEPER_URL
- GAS_LIMIT
- AQUARIUS_URL

## Development

1. Set up a virtual environment

1. Install requirements

    ```
    pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
    ```

1. Run Docker images. Alternatively, set up and run some or all of the corresponding services locally.

    ```
    docker-compose -f ./docker/docker-compose.yml up
    ```

    It runs an Aquarius node and an Ethereum RPC client. For details, read `docker-compose.yml`.

1. Create local configuration file

    ```
    cp config.ini config_local.ini
    ```

   `config_local.ini` is used by unit tests.

1. Copy keeper artifacts
    
    A bash script is available to copy keeper artifacts into this file directly from a running docker image. This script needs to run in the root of the project.
    The script waits until the keeper contracts are deployed, and then copies the artifacts.

    ```
    ./scripts/wait_for_migration_and_extract_keeper_artifacts.sh
    ```

    The artifacts contain the addresses of all the deployed contracts and their ABI definitions required to interact with them.

1. Run the unit tests

    ```
    python3 setup.py test
    ```

#### Code style

The information about code style in python is documented in this two links [python-developer-guide](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/dev-ocean/blob/master/doc/development/python-developer-guide.md)
and [python-style-guide](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/dev-ocean/blob/master/doc/development/python-style-guide.md).
    
#### Testing

Automatic tests are setup via Travis, executing `tox`.
Our test use pytest framework.
